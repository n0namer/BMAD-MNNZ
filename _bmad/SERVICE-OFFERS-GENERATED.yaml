    title: "Parallel Workflow Orchestration Training Program"
    subtitle: "Master hierarchical coordination patterns for bug-fixing teams"

    description: |
      Teach entrepreneurs and agencies how to deploy 8-agent parallel swarms
      for complex software projects, using the exact hierarchical coordination
      framework you just implemented.

    target_market:
      primary: "Engineering managers, dev agencies, technical founders"
      secondary: "AI/ML teams, DevOps teams, QA departments"
      buyer_persona: "45-year-old CTO managing 20+ engineers, wants to scale QA without hiring"
      pain_solved: "Manual error fixing takes weeks; parallel orchestration reduces to hours"

    pitch: |
      "Your team spends 40 hours fixing bugs sequentially. We show you how to:
       1. Deploy 8 specialized agents in parallel (hierarchical topology)
       2. Guarantee zero contamination or coordination conflicts
       3. Auto-detect when agents drift and auto-correct
       4. Validate results across 26+ test scenarios simultaneously

       Result: Same bugs fixed in 8 hours instead of 40. Proven on the
       Content Machine Pipeline with 100% QA pass rate."
