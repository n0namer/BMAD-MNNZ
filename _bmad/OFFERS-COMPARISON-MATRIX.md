### Risk Analysis

#### OFFER 1: Training - Moderate Risk
```
Upside: Builds authority, generates leads for offer_2, passive income potential
Downside: Competitive market, requires charisma/teaching skill
Risk Level: Medium
Mitigation:
  - Start with small cohorts (5-8 people)
  - Get testimonials from offer_2 clients
  - Build unique angle (battle-tested orchestration patterns)
  - Record videos early for refunds/flexibility
```

#### OFFER 2: Services - Low Risk ⭐
```
Upside: Immediate revenue, proven delivery process, case studies for offer_3
Downside: Time-bound, doesn't scale easily, requires ops discipline
Risk Level: Low
Mitigation:
  - You have the framework (proven)
  - You have documentation (repeatable)
  - You have reference (your own project)
  - Hire help at month 6 when you have cash
```

#### OFFER 3: SaaS - High Risk
```
Upside: Unlimited scale, recurring revenue, highest ceiling
Downside: 6-month runway before revenue, competitive market, needs execution
Risk Level: High
Mitigation:
  - Launch after 2+ offer_2 success stories
  - Build with proven framework (de-risk)
  - Start with MVP (4-6 weeks, not 12)
  - Pre-sell to 5 customers before full build
  - Hire technical co-founder (shared risk)
```

#### OFFER 4: Templates - Low Risk
```
Upside: No customers needed, passive income, lead gen for offer_2
Downside: Small market, commoditized, race to bottom on price
Risk Level: Low
Mitigation:
  - Price premium ($800+) for battle-tested frameworks
  - Bundle with support tier for differentiation
  - Use as lead gen (convert to offer_2 at $15K)
  - Create multiple templates (reduce reliance on one)
```

## Hybrid Strategies

### Strategy A: "Immediate Revenue + Long-term Scale" ⭐ RECOMMENDED
```
MONTHS 1-2:  Launch Offer 2 (services) + Offer 4 (templates)
             - Offer 2: Land 1-2 clients = $30K-50K
             - Offer 4: 30-50 sales = $20-40K
             REVENUE: $50-90K

MONTHS 3-4:  Add Offer 1 (training bootcamp)
             - Teach what you learned from Offer 2
             - 1 cohort @ 8 people @ $2,000 = $16K
             - Lead gen for Offer 2
             REVENUE: +$16K (cumulative: $66-106K)

MONTHS 5-8:  Land 2 more Offer 2 clients (case studies from first 2)
             - 2 × $18K = $36K
             - Retainers start: 3 × $3K × 4 months = $36K
             REVENUE: +$72K (cumulative: $138-178K)

MONTHS 9-12: Decide on Offer 3 (SaaS)
             - If demand signals strong: Begin MVP development
             - If revenue plateau: Focus on scaling offer_2
             REVENUE: Continue above + template passive income

YEAR 1 TOTAL: $180-240K
YEAR 2 TOTAL: $400-600K (mature offer_2 + offer_1 + offer_3 beta)
```

### Strategy B: "Premium Service + Productize Later"
```
MONTHS 1-6:   Offer 2 only (services)
              - Land 3-4 high-quality clients
              - Build reputation as expert
              - Generate detailed case studies
              REVENUE: $90-140K

MONTHS 7-12:  Add Offer 4 + Offer 1
              - Templates: repurpose service work
              - Bootcamp: teach proven patterns
              REVENUE: +$50-70K

MONTHS 13+:   Launch Offer 3 (SaaS)
              - Use Offer 2 success stories
              - Use Offer 1 students as beta
              REVENUE: +$200K-500K (year 2+)

YEAR 1 TOTAL: $140-210K
YEAR 2 TOTAL: $500-1M (mature offer_2 + offer_3)
```

### Strategy C: "Thought Leader + Multiple Streams"
```
IMMEDIATE:   All 4 offers in parallel
             - Offer 1: Bootcamp Q1 (January launch)
             - Offer 2: Service clients (2-3 concurrent)
             - Offer 3: SaaS MVP development (background)
             - Offer 4: Templates launched immediately

This assumes:
- You can handle chaos (split focus)
- You hire help quickly (by month 3)
- You have co-founder for Offer 3 SaaS
- You're comfortable with complexity

HIGH REWARD: Potential $1M+ revenue in year 2
HIGH RISK: Execution risk across 4 fronts
RECOMMENDED: Only if you have team/co-founder
```
