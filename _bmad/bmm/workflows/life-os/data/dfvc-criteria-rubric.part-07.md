- **RICE Prioritization** (Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort) - Simplified alternative
- **ICE Scoring** (Impact × Confidence × Ease) - Faster but less granular
- **Porter's Five Forces** (Competition dimension basis)
- **Lean Canvas** (Desirability and Viability validation)
- **Jobs-to-be-Done** (Need Intensity assessment)
- **Unit Economics Playbook** (Viability sub-criteria)
- **Blue Ocean Strategy** (Competition analysis)

**When to use D/F/V/C vs. alternatives**:
- Use D/F/V/C for strategic project selection (high-stakes, multi-dimensional)
- Use RICE/ICE for feature prioritization (tactical, speed over precision)
- Use Lean Canvas for rapid validation (early-stage, hypothesis-driven)
