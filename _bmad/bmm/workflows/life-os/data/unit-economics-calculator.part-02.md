| Payback Period | Rating | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| **<6 months** | 🟢 Excellent | Fast recovery, low risk |
| **6-12 months** | 🟢 Good | Standard for most SaaS |
| **12-18 months** | 🟡 Acceptable | Requires more capital |
| **>18 months** | 🔴 Risky | High capital needs, long break-even |

### Why Payback Period Matters

- **Cash Flow**: Shorter payback = less capital required to grow
- **Risk**: Longer payback = more exposure to churn before break-even
- **Scalability**: <12 months allows for self-funded growth

## 5. Complete Unit Economics Worksheet

### Input Variables

```
[ ] Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): $_______ / month
[ ] Gross Margin %: _______% (typically 70-90% for SaaS)
[ ] Monthly Churn Rate: _______% (or annual churn)
[ ] Total S&M Costs (monthly): $_______
[ ] New Customers Acquired (monthly): _______
```

### Calculated Metrics

```
CLV = (ARPU × Gross Margin %) × (1 / Churn Rate)
CLV = ($_______ × _____%) × (1 / _____%)
CLV = $_______

CAC = Total S&M Costs / New Customers
CAC = $_______ / _______
CAC = $_______

CLV/CAC Ratio = CLV / CAC
CLV/CAC Ratio = $_______ / $_______
CLV/CAC Ratio = _______

Payback Period = CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin %)
Payback Period = $_______ / ($_______ × _____%)
Payback Period = _______ months
```

### Validation Checklist

```
[ ] Gross Margin ≥ 60% (preferably 75%+)
[ ] Monthly Churn ≤ 10% (preferably <5%)
[ ] CLV/CAC Ratio ≥ 3.0
[ ] Payback Period ≤ 12 months (preferably <6 months)
[ ] CLV > $500 (for B2B SaaS, higher for enterprise)
```

**Decision**:
- ✅ **All checks pass** → Economics validated, proceed to next stage
- ⚠️ **1-2 checks fail** → Identify improvements, re-calculate
- 🛑 **3+ checks fail** → Re-think business model, pricing, or target market

## 6. Improvement Strategies

### If CLV is Too Low

**Increase ARPU**:
- Higher pricing tiers
- Upsell/cross-sell opportunities
- Usage-based pricing components
- Annual contracts (12 months upfront)

**Reduce Churn**:
- Better onboarding
- Customer success programs
- Product improvements (retention features)
- Lock-in mechanisms (integrations, data)

**Improve Gross Margin**:
- Reduce COGS (hosting, support, payment fees)
- Automate customer support
- Optimize infrastructure costs

### If CAC is Too High

**Optimize Paid Channels**:
- Better ad targeting
- A/B test ad creatives
- Improve landing page conversion
- Reduce cost-per-click (CPC)

**Increase Organic Channels**:
- SEO and content marketing
- Referral programs
- Product-led growth (viral loops)
- Community building

**Improve Conversion Rates**:
- Better sales process
- Self-serve onboarding
- Free trial optimization
- Reduce sales cycle length

### If Payback Period is Too Long

**Shorten via Pricing**:
- Annual upfront contracts
- Setup fees
- Higher initial pricing

**Shorten via Growth Efficiency**:
- Reduce CAC (see above)
- Increase ARPU (see above)

## 7. Stage-Specific Guidelines

### Pre-MVP / Idea Stage

**Estimate** unit economics using:
- Comparable companies (public data, similar products)
- Industry benchmarks
- Analyst reports
- Conservative assumptions (worse-case scenarios)

**Example Estimation**:
```
Comparable SaaS: Slack, Notion, etc.
Assumed ARPU: $10-15/user/month
Assumed Churn: 5-10% monthly
Assumed CAC: $50-150 (mostly organic initially)

Estimated CLV: $100-300
Estimated CAC: $50-150
Estimated Ratio: 2-6x

Conclusion: Plausible economics, worth testing
```

### MVP / Early Traction

**Measure** actual metrics from first 50-100 customers:
- Real ARPU from pricing experiments
- Observed churn (even if sample is small)
- Actual CAC from early channels

**Adjust** frequently as data improves (monthly recalculation)

### Growth Stage

**Optimize** unit economics at scale:
- Segment by channel (organic vs paid)
- Segment by customer type (SMB vs Enterprise)
- Track cohort-based retention
- Optimize payback period to <12 months

## 8. Integration with Life OS Workflow

### Step 01: Problem Discovery
- Rough CLV/CAC estimate based on market research
- Identify target customer segment's willingness to pay

### Step 02: Evaluation (THIS STEP)
- **Required**: Complete unit economics calculation
- **Validation**: CLV/CAC ≥ 3, Payback ≤ 12 months
- **Output**: Completed worksheet + validation checklist

### Step 03: Concept Development
- Use CLV to inform pricing strategy
- Use CAC to plan go-to-market budget

### Step 04: Validation (Testing)
- Measure actual ARPU, churn, CAC from MVP/beta
- Compare to estimates, adjust business model if needed
