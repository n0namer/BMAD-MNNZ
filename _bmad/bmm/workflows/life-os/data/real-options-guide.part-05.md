RISKIEST ASSUMPTIONS:
1. I can find consulting clients
2. I can do consulting work profitably
3. I have enough savings to sustain 3-6 months without income
4. Consulting lifestyle fits me

EXPERIMENT CHAIN:

Experiment 1: Market Test ($500, 3 weeks)
├─ While employed, reach out to 50 old colleagues
├─ Offer discount: "Helping with [problem] at $100/hour"
├─ Goal: Get 1-2 clients, 10 hours/month billable work
├─ Test: Can I actually do client work + keep job?
├─ Output: Proof of concept
└─ Decision: Clients exist? Move to next phase

Experiment 2: Side Project Scaling ($0, 3 months)
├─ Continue while employed, grow to 15-20 hours/month
├─ Develop service offering more formally
├─ Build: Website, case studies, testimonials
├─ Target revenue: $2-3K/month (time allowing)
├─ Output: Repeatable business model (time-permitting)
└─ Decision: Does work + job = burnout? Sustainable?

Experiment 3: 3-Month Trial ($20K buffer, 3 months)
├─ Quit job, work full-time on consulting
├─ Target: $5-8K/month recurring revenue
├─ Measure: Hours worked, client satisfaction, income stability
├─ Constraint: 3-month runway max
├─ Output: Can I sustain on consulting income?
└─ Decision: Viable business or return to employment?

Experiment 4: Stabilization (6-12 months)
├─ If experiment 3 works, stabilize at 4-5 clients
├─ Goal: $10K/month sustainable, 40-50 hours/week
├─ Consider: Agency? Productized service? Team?
└─ Decision: Scale further or optimize for lifestyle

INVESTMENT ANALYSIS:
Time Cost (Experiment 1-2):
  - 10 hours/week × 12 weeks = 120 hours
  - Opportunity cost at $100/hour = $12K
  - Actual cash: $500

Financial Risk (Experiment 3):
  - Cash burn: $20K (3-month personal runway)
  - Worst case: Return to job market (2-4 month search)
  - Total downside: $20K + opportunity cost of 3 months

Upside (If Successful):
  - Income: $10K/month × 12 = $120K/year
  - Autonomy: 50-hour weeks, choose clients
  - Growth: Scale to agency (millions)

Expected Value (Simple):
  P(success) = 40% (consulting client base exists, scalable)
  P(fail) = 60% (personal resistance, market too competitive)

  E[Value | success] = $120K/year income + lifestyle benefit
  E[Value | fail] = $0 income + 3-month job search = -$20K cash

  E[NPV] = 0.4 × $120K + 0.6 × (-$20K) = $48K - $12K = $36K/year

  But with Option to Exit Early:
  - Month 1 signal: If no clients → Return to job (saves $40K)
  - Month 2 signal: If <$2K revenue → Return to job (saves $20K)
  - Month 3 signal: If <$3K revenue → Return to job (saves full runway)

  Exit Option Value ≈ $30-40K (ability to stop and restart job)

DECISION POINTS:
- Week 3: $500 invested. Do I have clients? Continue or accept job?
- Week 15: $12K opportunity cost. Can I scale to 15 hours/week? Continue?
- Month 4: $20K cash out. Do I have $5K+ monthly revenue? Continue?
- Month 7: $50K total cost. Sustainable? Continue or return to job?

RECOMMENDATION:
✅ Use real options - Sequential experiments before full commitment
✅ Phase 1 validates market (can clients be found?)
✅ Phase 2 validates sustainability (side work + job?)
✅ Phase 3 validates scalability (full-time viable?)
✅ Total cost of learning ≈ $20-30K and 6 months
✅ Downside protected by early exit + job market
✅ Proceed if Phase 1-2 successful, Phase 3 provides final validation

## 8. Summary & Next Steps

### When to Apply Real Options Framework

✅ **Use Real Options When:**
- High uncertainty (technology, market, regulations)
- Can test cheaply before full commitment
- Information arriving within 6-24 months
- Large irreversible investment required
- Multiple paths/options exist
- Early decision signals available

❌ **Use Traditional NPV When:**
- Low uncertainty, proven model
- First-mover advantage critical
- Information unlikely to change
- Option cost > benefit of waiting
- One clear path forward

### Key Principles

1. **Cheap Experiments First:** Always design cheapest test of riskiest assumption
2. **Sequential Commitment:** Break decision into stages with go/kill gates
3. **Probability Updates:** Use experiment results to refine decision
4. **Option Value:** Quantify benefit of waiting vs cost of delay
5. **Flexibility Pricing:** Build cost of preserving options into plan

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Identify riskiest assumption(s)
- [ ] Design Level 1 experiment (cheap, <2 weeks)
- [ ] Run experiment, collect data
- [ ] Update probability based on results
- [ ] Calculate option value of continuing
- [ ] Go/kill/pivot decision
- [ ] If go → Design next experiment
- [ ] Iterate until full commitment decision
