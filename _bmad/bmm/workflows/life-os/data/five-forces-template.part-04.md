**Every 3 months, reassess:**
1. Has any force shifted significantly?
2. Are new entrants appearing?
3. New substitutes?
4. Buyer/supplier dynamics changing?
5. Competitive moves?

**Document changes:**
```
Date: Q1 2025
Force 1 (Entrants): 8 → 7 (New entrants emerged, raising entry risk)
Force 2 (Substitutes): 8 → 7 (New AI substitutes becoming viable)
New Overall Score: 7.2 → 6.8 (Slightly less attractive)
Action: Monitor entrants closely, accelerate differentiation
```

### Trigger Events for Reassessment

**Immediate reassessment if:**
- Major new competitor enters
- New substitute technology emerges
- Regulatory change
- Key supplier changes terms
- Major customer acquisition/loss
- Market consolidation

## Key Takeaways

1. **Five Forces is predictive** - High attractiveness often means good investment; low means reconsider
2. **Focus on weakest force** - It determines overall industry health
3. **Differentiation beats commoditization** - When forces are weak, differentiate rather than compete on price
4. **Monitor continuously** - Markets shift; what's attractive today may be brutal tomorrow
5. **Use in all spheres** - Career, business, investment, personal - same framework applies
6. **Combine with D/F/V/C** - Five Forces informs Competence (Do I have advantages?), Activity (Can I execute?), Business Model (Can I make money?), Discipline (Can I sustain?)
