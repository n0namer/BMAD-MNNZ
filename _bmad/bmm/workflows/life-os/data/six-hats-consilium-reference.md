## Hat-Specific Questions

Use these prompts to guide specialists toward their hat's perspective:

### ⚪ White Hat (Facts & Data)
**Question:** "What facts and data do we have? What's missing?"

**Focus:** Objective information, neutral analysis, known data, gaps in knowledge

**Example:** "Market analysis shows 35% growth in segment X, but we lack data on customer retention rates."

---

### 🔴 Red Hat (Emotions & Intuition)
**Question:** "What's your gut feeling? What emotions does this evoke?"

**Focus:** Intuitive responses, emotional reactions, hunches, instinct

**Example:** "My gut says this timing feels off. The excitement around the idea feels forced, not genuine."

---

### ⚫ Black Hat (Risks & Caution)
**Question:** "What could go wrong? What risks do we need to mitigate?"

**Focus:** Critical judgment, risks, weaknesses, what won't work

**Example:** "If we launch without proper testing, we risk alienating early adopters with bugs and broken features."

---

### 🟡 Yellow Hat (Benefits & Optimism)
**Question:** "What are the benefits? Why is this worth doing?"

**Focus:** Positive thinking, value proposition, opportunities, why it will work

**Example:** "This approach could unlock a new revenue stream worth $500K annually while reducing operational costs by 20%."

---

### 🟢 Green Hat (Creativity & Alternatives)
**Question:** "What creative alternatives exist? How can we innovate?"

**Focus:** New ideas, possibilities, alternatives, innovation, lateral thinking

**Example:** "What if instead of building it ourselves, we partner with an existing platform and white-label their solution?"

---

### 🔵 Blue Hat (Process & Organization)
**Question:** "How should we structure this? What's the right process?"

**Focus:** Meta-thinking, process control, agenda, next steps, organization

**Example:** "Let's pause and clarify our objectives first. Then we can prioritize which specialists to consult and in what order."

## Execution Protocol

**How to use Six Hats in consilium:**

1. **Auto-assign hats** based on specialist type (use table above)
2. **Present hat-specific question** from their perspective
3. **Ask user to provide or confirm their input**
4. **Record each recommendation** with hat color prefix
5. **Ask 1-2 specialists at a time** and adapt based on user response

**Prompt format for each specialist:**

```
{Specialist Name} ({Hat Color} Hat - {Perspective}), please share your view:
- {Hat-specific question}

Keep recommendations focused on your hat's perspective.
```

## Synthesis: Balanced Multi-Perspective Consensus

**After gathering all perspectives, synthesize consensus by balancing:**

- ⚪ White Hat facts (data-driven insights)
- 🔴 Red Hat intuition (emotional/gut responses)
- ⚫ Black Hat cautions (risks and concerns)
- 🟡 Yellow Hat benefits (opportunities and value)
- 🟢 Green Hat creativity (alternatives and innovation)
- 🔵 Blue Hat structure (process and organization)

**This creates a balanced, multi-perspective decision vs single-viewpoint bias.**

**Consensus template:**

```markdown
## Consilium Recommendations (Six Hats)

**Mode:** {Lite/Deep}
**Specialists Consulted:**
- {Specialist 1} ({Hat Color} Hat - {Perspective}): {key recommendations}
- {Specialist 2} ({Hat Color} Hat - {Perspective}): {key recommendations}
- {Specialist 3} ({Hat Color} Hat - {Perspective}): {key recommendations}

**Consensus View (Balanced):**
- {synthesis balancing all hat perspectives}
- {key decision informed by multi-perspective input}
```

## Why Six Hats Works

**Problem:** Traditional group discussions mix perspectives (facts, emotions, risks) chaotically
**Solution:** Parallel thinking - everyone wears same hat at same time
**Benefit:** Clear, organized discussion without ego conflicts

**Research Evidence:**
- IBM: 75% reduction in meeting time for complex decisions
- NASA: Improved risk assessment accuracy by 40%
- Used in 60+ countries for strategic planning

## Integration with Other Methods

### Six Hats + SCAMPER
- Use Green Hat specialists as SCAMPER input
- Black Hat pairs with "Eliminate" prompt
- Yellow Hat pairs with "Combine" prompt

### Six Hats + TRIZ
- When hats conflict (White vs Red, Black vs Yellow) → TRIZ contradiction resolution
- Multi-hat synthesis creates rich contradictions for TRIZ analysis

### Six Hats + Scoring (MCDA)
- White Hat feeds Impact/Confidence scores
- Black Hat feeds Risk scores
- Yellow Hat feeds Strategic Alignment
- Balanced scoring across all perspectives
