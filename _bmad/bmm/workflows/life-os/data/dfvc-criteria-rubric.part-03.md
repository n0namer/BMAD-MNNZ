## 4. Competition (C) - Can We Win?

### Definition
Analyzes competitive landscape, market position, and strategic defensibility.

### Sub-Criteria

#### 4.1 Five Forces Score (Porter's Framework)
**What it measures**: Overall competitive intensity across 5 dimensions

**Five Forces Breakdown**:
1. **Threat of new entrants** (barriers to entry)
2. **Bargaining power of suppliers**
3. **Bargaining power of buyers**
4. **Threat of substitutes**
5. **Rivalry among existing competitors**

**Scoring Scale (1-10):**
- **1-2**: Red ocean - High competition, all 5 forces unfavorable
- **3-4**: Crowded market - 3-4 forces unfavorable, intense pressure
- **5-6**: Competitive - 2-3 forces unfavorable, manageable
- **7-8**: Favorable - 1-2 forces unfavorable, strategic advantage
- **9-10**: Blue ocean - All 5 forces favorable, minimal competition

**Evidence Required**:
- Competitor analysis (top 5 players, market share)
- Barrier analysis (capital, technology, network effects, regulations)
- Substitute mapping (alternative solutions customers use)

**Example Anchors**:
- Score 2: Restaurant in saturated market (low barriers, high rivalry, many substitutes)
- Score 6: B2B SaaS in growing niche (moderate barriers, 3-5 competitors)
- Score 10: First mover in regulatory-protected niche (high barriers, no rivals)

---

#### 4.2 Barriers to Entry (Moat Strength)
**What it measures**: Defensibility and protection from new competitors

**Moat Types** (from strongest to weakest):
1. **Network effects** - Value increases with each user (10 points)
2. **Intellectual property** - Patents, trade secrets (9 points)
3. **Switching costs** - High friction to change providers (8 points)
4. **Economies of scale** - Cost advantages at scale (7 points)
5. **Brand/reputation** - Customer loyalty and trust (6 points)
6. **Regulatory/compliance** - Licenses, certifications (6 points)
7. **Data moat** - Proprietary dataset improves over time (8 points)

**Scoring Scale (1-10):**
- **1-2**: No moat - Easy to replicate, low switching costs
- **3-4**: Weak moat - 1 minor barrier (brand, small scale advantage)
- **5-6**: Moderate moat - 1-2 barriers (switching costs + brand)
- **7-8**: Strong moat - 2+ barriers including network effects or IP
- **9-10**: Exceptional moat - Multiple reinforcing barriers (network effects + data + IP)

**Evidence Required**:
- Moat inventory (which types apply?)
- Switching cost analysis (time, money, risk for customer to switch)
- Competitive response time (how long to replicate?)

**Example Anchors**:
- Score 2: Generic website builder (no moat, easy to replicate)
- Score 6: Niche CRM with 3-month implementation (switching cost moat)
- Score 10: Marketplace with network effects + proprietary matching algorithm (IP + network effects)

---

#### 4.3 Threat of Substitutes
**What it measures**: How many alternative solutions exist and their quality

**Scoring Scale (1-10):**
- **1-2**: Many better substitutes - Customers prefer alternatives
- **3-4**: Several comparable substitutes - Price competition
- **5-6**: Few substitutes, but viable - Mixed preference
- **7-8**: Limited substitutes, inferior quality - Clear advantage
- **9-10**: No substitutes - Unique solution, category creation

**Evidence Required**:
- Substitute mapping (direct competitors + indirect alternatives)
- Customer preference data (solution A vs. B vs. status quo)
- Jobs-to-be-done analysis (what are customers hiring this solution for?)

**Example Anchors**:
- Score 2: Generic task management app (100+ alternatives, Notion/Asana preferred)
- Score 6: Specialized accounting for dentists (general accounting available, but less tailored)
- Score 10: First AI-powered legal contract analyzer (no comparable alternative)

---

#### 4.4 Market Timing
**What it measures**: Is this the right time to enter? (Too early, perfect, too late)

**Scoring Scale (1-10):**
- **1-2**: Missed window - Market saturated or declining
- **3-4**: Late - Established leaders, uphill battle
- **5-6**: Competitive - Growing market, but crowded
- **7-8**: Good timing - Market inflection point, early mover advantage
- **9-10**: Perfect timing - Emerging trend, no competition yet

**Evidence Required**:
- Market growth rate (CAGR, trajectory)
- Technology adoption curve position (innovators → early majority)
- Macro trends (regulatory changes, technology shifts, consumer behavior)

**Example Anchors**:
- Score 2: Launching DVD rental business in 2023 (missed streaming shift)
- Score 6: New project management SaaS (growing market, but crowded)
- Score 10: AI coding assistant in 2023 (early wave, explosive demand)

### Competition Aggregation Formula

```
C_score = (Five_Forces × 0.30) + (Barriers_to_Entry × 0.30) + (Threat_of_Substitutes × 0.20) + (Market_Timing × 0.20)
```

**Rationale for Weights**:
- **Five Forces (30%)**: Comprehensive competitive landscape view
- **Barriers to Entry (30%)**: Long-term defensibility
- **Threat of Substitutes (20%)**: Immediate competitive pressure
- **Market Timing (20%)**: Strategic opportunity window

**Sphere-Specific Weight Adjustments**:

| Sphere | Five Forces | Barriers to Entry | Threat of Substitutes | Market Timing | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Business** | 0.25 | 0.30 | 0.25 | 0.20 | Moat and competition key |
| **Finance** | 0.30 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.20 | Competitive alpha critical |
| **Personal** | 0.10 | 0.15 | 0.35 | 0.40 | Timing and uniqueness matter (less about moat) |
| **Product** | 0.30 | 0.30 | 0.20 | 0.20 | Standard weights |
| **Health** | 0.15 | 0.20 | 0.35 | 0.30 | Alternative solutions and timing |
| **Creative** | 0.10 | 0.25 | 0.30 | 0.35 | Uniqueness and timing trump competition |
| **Social Impact** | 0.20 | 0.25 | 0.30 | 0.25 | Alternatives and sustainability |

## 5. Normalization & Total Score Calculation

### Formula

```
Total_Score = (D_score × W_D) + (F_score × W_F) + (V_score × W_V) + (C_score × W_C)

Where:
  W_D + W_F + W_V + W_C = 1.0 (weights sum to 100%)
```

### Sphere-Specific Weight Tables

#### Business Projects (Standard Weights)
| Dimension | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Desirability (D) | 0.35 | Market demand drives everything |
| Feasibility (F) | 0.20 | Execution risk manageable with resources |
| Viability (V) | 0.30 | Profitability critical for sustainability |
| Competition (C) | 0.15 | Competitive position important but not dominant |

**When to use**: SaaS products, B2B services, e-commerce, marketplace platforms
