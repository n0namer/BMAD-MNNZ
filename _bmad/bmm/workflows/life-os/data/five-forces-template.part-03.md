## Worked Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Market Analysis (Highly Attractive)

**Context:** Considering entry into productivity SaaS market

#### Force Analysis

| Force | Score | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **New Entrants** | 8 | High barriers: Need product development, customer acquisition, integrations |
| **Substitutes** | 8 | Few: Established players dominant (Slack, Asana, Monday.com) with switching costs |
| **Buyer Power** | 7 | Moderate: Many vendors available, but enterprise customers have leverage |
| **Supplier Power** | 9 | Low supplier power: Cloud infrastructure abundant, open-source libraries available |
| **Rivalry** | 7 | Moderate: Fragmented market with niches, not all-consuming |

**Overall Score:** 7.8/10 (Attractive)

**Strategic Recommendation:**
- Invest in entry through **niche differentiation** (not head-to-head)
- Target underserved segment (e.g., distributed teams, specific industry)
- Build switching costs through integrations and customization
- Maintain low supplier dependency (multi-cloud, open source)

**Action Plan:**
- ✅ Identify niche with weak competition
- ✅ Build integration moat (Zapier, native integrations)
- ✅ Target early adopters who value differentiation over lowest price
- ✅ Plan acquisition strategy (venture or organic growth)

### Example 2: E-Commerce Marketplace (Moderate Attractiveness)

**Context:** Considering vertical marketplace (e.g., artisan goods)

#### Force Analysis

| Force | Score | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **New Entrants** | 4 | Low barriers: Easy to build platform, Amazon/Etsy exist, anyone can start marketplace |
| **Substitutes** | 5 | Moderate: Amazon, Etsy, Instagram, direct-to-consumer sites all compete |
| **Buyer Power** | 3 | High power: Fragmented sellers, buyers have infinite choice, price sensitive |
| **Supplier Power** | 6 | Moderate: Many sellers, but they can also go direct or multi-list |
| **Rivalry** | 3 | Intense: Many general and vertical marketplaces, race to bottom |

**Overall Score:** 4.2/10 (Challenging)

**Strategic Recommendation:**
- Enter **only with strong differentiation** (not generic marketplace)
- Build community/curation (reduce buyer choice overload)
- Create seller lock-in through unique features, traffic, or brand
- Focus on vertical (not horizontal) to reduce rivalry

**Action Plan:**
- ✅ Choose niche with underserved sellers and buyers
- ✅ Build community features (reviews, curator picks, education)
- ✅ Invest in discovery/curation (reduce choice paralysis)
- ✅ Develop seller tools (analytics, marketing) to create lock-in
- ✅ Prepare for low margins and high competition

### Example 3: Restaurant Business (Low Attractiveness)

**Context:** Considering opening a new restaurant

#### Force Analysis

| Force | Score | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **New Entrants** | 2 | Very low: Easy to open restaurant, low regulatory barriers in many areas |
| **Substitutes** | 2 | High: Food delivery, meal prep, groceries, fast casual all compete |
| **Buyer Power** | 1 | Very high: Millions of dining options, customers extremely price/experience sensitive |
| **Supplier Power** | 4 | Moderate/High: Food costs volatile, many suppliers but some local limits |
| **Rivalry** | 1 | Intense: Extremely competitive, many small operators, race to bottom on pricing |

**Overall Score:** 2.0/10 (Unattractive for Generic Restaurant)

**Strategic Recommendation:**
- ❌ **Do NOT enter as generic restaurant** (high failure rate ~70% in first 5 years)
- ✅ **Enter with strong differentiation only:**
  - Unique concept/cuisine
  - Prime location with competitive advantage
  - Celebrity/brand backing
  - Technology-enabled efficiency
  - Niche focus (meal prep for fitness market)

- ✅ Secure location before competition
- ✅ Build supply chain efficiency to reduce food costs
- ✅ Plan for 18-24 months to profitability
