# Integration Patterns (Reference)

## Patterns
- Standalone: no dependencies
- Platform Extension: builds on Core Platform
- Bundle: multiple projects share resources
- Enabler: unblocks other projects

## Questions
- Does this share infrastructure with existing projects?
- Can it reuse platform components?
- Does it block or enable other projects?
