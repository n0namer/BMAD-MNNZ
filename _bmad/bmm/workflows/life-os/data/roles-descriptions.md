## Role Selection Heuristics

### When to Include Multiple Roles
- **Complex projects**: 3-5 roles across 2-3 spheres
- **Simple goals**: 1-2 roles from single sphere
- **Cross-functional**: Include bridging roles (e.g., Project Manager + specialists)

### Red Flags (Too Many Roles)
- More than 6 roles → Consider breaking into sub-projects
- Overlapping responsibilities → Merge similar roles
- All priorities marked "high" → Re-evaluate criticality

### Role Maturity Levels
| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Starter** | Basic profile, minimal details | Generic "Advisor" |
| **Defined** | Clear scope, typical contributions | "Financial Planner" with specific deliverables |
| **Specialized** | Domain expert, deep context | "Healthcare CFO" with industry constraints |

## Integration with Deep Plan

**Mapping to Templates:**
- Each role → default_template in roles-base.csv
- Template guides deep plan structure in step-08
- Ensures consistent deliverables per role
