# Portfolio Health (Reference)

## Healthy Allocation Targets
- Fast Cash: 10–20%
- Autonomous SaaS: 40–50%
- Core Platform: 20–30%
- Big Bets: 10–20%

## Warnings
- Fast Cash > 30%: too short-term focused
- Autonomous SaaS < 30%: not enough scalable revenue
- Core Platform > 40%: infrastructure overkill
- Big Bets > 30%: too much risk
- WIP > 2: limit exceeded

## Rebalancing Actions
- Fast Cash > 30% → defer new or kill lowest-value fast cash
- Big Bets > 30% → kill lowest-probability big bet
- Core Platform > 40% → defer platform work
- Autonomous SaaS < 30% → prioritize SaaS
- WIP > 2 → block new project, propose kill candidates
