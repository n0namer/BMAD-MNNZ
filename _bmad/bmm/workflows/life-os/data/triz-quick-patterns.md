# TRIZ Quick Patterns Reference Guide

## What is TRIZ?

**TRIZ** (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, Russian: Теория решения изобретательских задач) is a systematic methodology for creative problem-solving and innovation developed by Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues in the former Soviet Union (1946-1985).

**Core Insight:** Altshuller analyzed over 200,000 patents and discovered that:
- Problems and solutions repeat across industries
- Innovation follows predictable patterns
- Technical contradictions can be systematically resolved
- Evolution of technical systems follows specific trends

**Creator:** Genrich Altshuller (1926-1998), Soviet inventor and engineer

**Key Discovery:** 90% of problems have been solved before in other domains. TRIZ provides a bridge to find and adapt those solutions.

## When to Use TRIZ in Life OS

### Triggers (When to Activate TRIZ)

**Use TRIZ when you encounter:**
1. **Contradictions** - "We need X, but X causes problem Y"
2. **Trade-off decisions** - Choosing between conflicting requirements
3. **"Impossible" problems** - Where conventional approaches fail
4. **Innovation needed** - Breaking through incremental improvements
5. **Resource constraints** - Must do more with less
6. **Conflicting stakeholder needs** - Multiple parties want opposite things

### Red Flags (TRIZ is Essential)

- **You hear:** "We can't have both..." or "It's either this or that..."
- **You see:** Circular arguments, paralysis by analysis
- **You feel:** Stuck between equally bad options
- **Pattern:** Same problem keeps returning despite fixes

### Ideal Scenarios

| Scenario | TRIZ Method | Expected Outcome |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Two goals conflict | Contradiction Matrix | Find principle that resolves both |
| "Perfect" solution needed | Ideal Final Result | Define end state, work backward |
| Complex system problem | ARIZ (Full Algorithm) | Systematic breakthrough |
| Need creative options | 40 Principles Scan | Generate 5-10 novel ideas |
| Resource limited | Substance-Field Analysis | Use existing resources cleverly |

## Types of Contradictions

### 1. Technical Contradiction

**Definition:** Improving one parameter worsens another parameter.

**Structure:** "If we improve [Parameter A], then [Parameter B] gets worse"

**Examples:**
- **Business:** "If we improve product quality (Parameter A), then manufacturing cost (Parameter B) increases"
- **Health:** "If we increase workout intensity (Parameter A), then recovery time (Parameter B) gets longer"
- **Personal:** "If we focus more time on career (Parameter A), then family time (Parameter B) decreases"
- **Finance:** "If we increase investment returns (Parameter A), then risk exposure (Parameter B) increases"

### 2. Physical Contradiction

**Definition:** The same parameter needs to have opposite values at the same time or under different conditions.

**Structure:** "Parameter X should be Y AND should be NOT Y"

**Examples:**
- **Business:** "Product should be customizable (flexible) AND standardized (uniform) at the same time"
- **Health:** "Coffee should be consumed (for energy) AND NOT consumed (for sleep quality)"
- **Personal:** "Schedule should be planned (for productivity) AND spontaneous (for creativity)"
- **Finance:** "Investment should be liquid (accessible) AND illiquid (locked for growth)"

**Resolution Strategies:**
- **Separation in Time:** Y during condition 1, NOT Y during condition 2
- **Separation in Space:** Y in location A, NOT Y in location B
- **Separation by Condition:** Y when X happens, NOT Y otherwise
- **System Level:** Y at component level, NOT Y at system level

### 3. Administrative Contradiction

**Definition:** The solution is known, but it cannot be implemented due to organizational, legal, or resource constraints.

**Structure:** "We know solution X works, but we cannot implement it because [constraint]"

**Examples:**
- **Business:** "We know automation works, but we cannot afford the upfront investment"
- **Health:** "We know daily exercise is best, but our schedule does not permit it"
- **Personal:** "We know learning language requires immersion, but we cannot move countries"
- **Finance:** "We know real estate is good investment, but we lack capital for down payment"

**Resolution:** Often requires reframing the problem or finding unconventional resources.

## The 40 Inventive Principles

### Principle 1: Segmentation

**Description:** Divide an object or system into independent parts, make it sectional or easy to disassemble, increase the degree of fragmentation.

**Business Example:** Instead of one large warehouse, create distributed micro-fulfillment centers near customers (reduces shipping time without increasing total space).

**Health Example:** Break 60-minute workout into 4×15-minute sessions throughout the day (same total exercise, fits busy schedule).

**Personal Example:** Split large life goals into weekly milestones (maintain motivation, track progress incrementally).

**Finance Example:** Dollar-cost averaging—invest fixed amount monthly instead of lump sum (reduces timing risk, smooths market volatility).

---

### Principle 2: Extraction / Taking Out

**Description:** Extract the disturbing part or property from an object, or extract only the necessary part or property.

**Business Example:** Remove non-core operations (accounting, HR) to specialized vendors, keep only competitive advantage in-house.

**Health Example:** Eliminate trigger foods from house entirely rather than trying to resist them (removes willpower drain).

**Personal Example:** Use "do not disturb" mode to extract distractions during deep work sessions.

**Finance Example:** Separate emergency fund into different account to prevent accidental spending on non-emergencies.

---

### Principle 3: Local Quality

**Description:** Change an object's structure from uniform to non-uniform, make each part function in conditions most suitable for its operation.

```markdown
## Ideal Final Result Statement

**Current Problem:**
[Describe what doesn't work now]

**Desired Outcome:**
[What needs to happen]

**IFR Statement:**
"[Object/System] [performs desired function] BY ITSELF,
WITHOUT [current cost/complexity/harm],
WHILE [maintaining or improving all other parameters]."

**Resources Available:**
- Internal: [What's already in the system]
- External: [What's available nearby]
- Derived: [What can be created from waste/byproducts]

**Constraints to Challenge:**
- [List assumptions to test]

**Current Problem:** Restrictive diets fail, hunger makes compliance hard

**IFR Statement:**
"Weight loss happens BY ITSELF, WITHOUT conscious calorie restriction or hunger, WHILE maintaining energy and enjoyment of food."

**Step Toward IFR:** Whole foods diet (naturally satiating) + activity increase (burn more passively) + better sleep (hormones regulate appetite)

#### Personal Example: Productivity
**Current Problem:** Procrastination, difficulty starting tasks

**IFR Statement:**
"Tasks complete themselves BY THEMSELVES, WITHOUT effort to start or maintain focus, WHILE delivering high-quality results."

**Step Toward IFR:** Implementation intentions ("When X, then Y") + environment design (remove friction) + make first step trivial (2-minute rule)

#### Finance Example: Saving Money
**Current Problem:** Forget to save, spend what's available

2. **Look up in matrix**: Find X (row) and Y (column) → Get principles
3. **Apply top principle**: How would this principle solve it?
4. **Check against IFR**: Does this approximate "perfect solution"?
5. **Implement and save to memory**: Document for future reuse

### Top 5 Principles to Memorize

1. **#10 Preliminary Action** - Do it in advance
2. **#1 Segmentation** - Break it into parts
3. **#35 Parameter Changes** - Adjust the variables
4. **#13 Inversion** - Turn it upside down
5. **#22 Blessing in Disguise** - Use the harm as benefit

### IFR One-Liner

"[Object] performs [function] BY ITSELF, WITHOUT [cost/harm], WHILE [maintaining everything else]."

### When to Use TRIZ

✅ DO use when you hear "We can't have both..."
✅ DO use when stuck between bad options
✅ DO use when incremental improvement isn't enough

❌ DON'T use for simple decisions
❌ DON'T use when constraint is genuinely immutable
❌ DON'T use when faster methods (heuristics) suffice
