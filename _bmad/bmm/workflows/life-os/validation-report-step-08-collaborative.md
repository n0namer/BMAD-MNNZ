## COLLABORATIVE STRENGTHS FOUND

### 1. **Progressive Questioning Pattern (Gold Standard)**

**Evidence across ALL steps:**
- step-01: "1-2 questions at a time"
- step-02: "Suggest roles, user confirms"
- step-03: "I suggest, you confirm"
- step-04: "Confirm each specialist's input"
- step-05: "Ask user for values + rationale for each criterion"
- step-08: "Ask 1-2 questions at a time, confirm each level"

**Impact:** User never feels interrogated or overwhelmed.

---

### 2. **Clear Role Reinforcement**

**Universal Rule in ALL steps:**
```
- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
```

**Specific role clarity:**
- step-01: "You are a thoughtful listener and idea clarifier"
- step-00.5: "You are a project stage analyst"
- step-00.6: "Resource analyst (not planner)"
- step-00.7: "Optimization strategist, not a conservative planner"
- step-04: "YOU ARE A FACILITATOR" (repeated 3 times)

**Impact:** AI never oversteps boundaries, user maintains control.

---

### 3. **User Confirmation Gates**

**Confirmation patterns throughout:**
- step-00: "[S]kip / [U]pdate / [R]e-enter"
- step-02: "[A]pprove / [M]odify / [C]ontinue"
- step-03: "[A]pprove / [M]odify / [C]ontinue"
- step-04: Quality self-validation + user checkpoint
- step-05: "[Y]es proceed / [N]o revise / [E]xplain criteria"
- step-08: "[Y]es/[N]o/[E]xplain" + menu options

**Impact:** User always has veto power and iteration options.

---

### 4. **Natural Language & Context**

**Examples of natural flow:**
- step-00: "Что дальше?" (What's next?)
- step-01: "Tell me about your new idea. What are you thinking?"
- step-02: "Какую идею мы сейчас оцениваем?" (Which idea are we evaluating?)
- step-04: "Let me analyze... I noticed..."
- step-05: "Let's ensure scores are specific and measurable"

**Impact:** Feels like conversation with expert partner, not form-filling.

---

### 5. **Proactive Guidance Without Overstepping**

**Examples:**
- step-00: Staleness detection, quick update menu
- step-00.5: "If user unsure: Let me help determine. Answer: Is there working code?"
- step-00.6: "Quick validation: 'just me and Claude' → ✅ Solo + LLM = 10x-20x"
- step-03: "Proactive guidance: highlight risks, opportunities"
- step-04: Auto-suggest framework after consilium (with confidence scoring)
- step-05: Domain-specific criteria auto-add (with user confirmation)
- step-v-02: "Proactive flagging: chronic blockers, critical path"

**Impact:** AI adds value without forcing decisions.

---

### 6. **Error Handling & Redirection**

**Examples:**
- step-02: "IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu"
- step-03: "Wait for user response... IF Any other: Help user respond"
- step-04: Mode auto-selection but user can override
- step-05: "If vague: Ask for concrete result, metrics, numbers"
- step-v-02: "Skip Warning: offer to complete at least top 3 sections"

**Impact:** User never gets stuck or lost.

---

### 7. **Clear Progression & Arc**

**Evidence:**
- step-00: Foundation check → skip if data exists (respects time)
- step-01: Collect → Track detection → Route appropriately
- step-04: Lite (5-10 min) vs Deep (15-30 min) based on complexity
- step-08: Track-based defaults (Quick=skip, Standard=L1-L3, Deep=L1-L6)
- Frontmatter tracks: `stepsCompleted` updated after each step

**Impact:** User always knows where they are and what's next.

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Strengths to Maintain:

1. ✅ **Progressive questioning** - Keep "1-2 questions at a time" rule
2. ✅ **Role reinforcement** - Keep "YOU ARE A FACILITATOR" in every step
3. ✅ **User confirmation gates** - Keep [A]pprove/[M]odify/[C]ontinue pattern
4. ✅ **Natural language** - Keep conversational tone
5. ✅ **Proactive guidance** - Keep intelligent suggestions with confidence scoring
6. ✅ **Error handling** - Keep "help user respond" patterns

1. Consider adding more examples in steps where users might be uncertain (step-00.5 already does this well)
2. Consider voice/tone consistency check across all step files (currently excellent)
3. Consider adding collaborative quality self-checks in more steps (step-04 and step-05 already do this)
