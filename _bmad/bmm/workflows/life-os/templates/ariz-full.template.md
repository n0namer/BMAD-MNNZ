**Problem as stated by user:**
{verbatim description from user}

**Domain:** {Business / Finance / Health / Personal}
**Impact if unsolved:** {consequences}

---

## 1.2 Min-Problem and Max-Problem

### Min-Problem
**Define:** The minimum change that would solve the problem

**Min-Problem statement:**
{What is the smallest possible change to the system that would eliminate the contradiction?}

**Example:**
"Change only the delivery process structure (not team size, not budget, not scope)"

---

### Max-Problem
**Define:** The problem at its maximum scope

**Max-Problem statement:**
{What is the largest version of this problem? How does it affect the entire system?}

**Example:**
"Not just this product launch - our entire company struggles with speed vs quality trade-offs across all projects"

---

## 1.3 Standard Problem Formulation

**Technical System:**
{Describe the technical system where problem occurs}

**Tool (what acts):**
{The component/process/agent that performs action}

**Object (what is acted upon):**
{The component/process/target that receives action}

**Conflict:**
{What happens when Tool acts on Object}

**Standard formulation:**
"{Tool} acts on {Object} to achieve {useful function}, but this causes {harmful effect} due to {reason}."

---

## 1.4 IFR-1 (First Approximation)

**Ideal Final Result statement:**
"{Object} by itself performs {useful function} without {harmful effects} and without {additional resources/complexity}."

**Example:**
"The product development process by itself ensures high quality without slowing delivery and without extra budget."

**What's preventing IFR-1 right now?**
1. {barrier 1}
2. {barrier 2}
3. {barrier 3}

---

# PART 2: PROBLEM MODEL ANALYSIS

---

## 2.2 Operative Time

**Definition:** The time period when conflict occurs

**Conflict Times:**

- Conflict Time T2: {when problem is most severe}
- Conflict Time T3: {when problem ends}

**Time before conflict:** {pre-conflict state}
**Time during conflict:** {conflict state}

**Can we separate in time?**
{Can Tool act at T1 and Object respond at T2, avoiding simultaneous conflict?}

**From internal VPR:**
- {derivative 1}: {from what + how}
- {derivative 2}: {from what + how}

**From external VPR:**
- {derivative 3}: {from what + how}

---

## 2.4 IFR-2 (Refined with VPR)

**Refined IFR using available resources:**
"{Available resource X} by itself performs {useful function} without {harmful effects} at {Operative Time} in {Operative Zone}."

**Example:**
"Existing team knowledge (VPR: internal) by itself ensures quality (function) without slowing delivery (no harmful effect) during development sprints (Operative Time) at code review stage (Operative Zone)."

**How much closer to ideal is IFR-2 vs IFR-1?**
{Assessment: does VPR analysis reveal path to solution?}

### 14.2 When to Use Full ARIZ

**Use Full ARIZ when:**

- Breakthrough innovation needed (not incremental improvement)
- Have 2-4 hours available for deep analysis
- Patent-level solution desired
- Problem is fundamental (not symptom)

**Don't use Full ARIZ when:**
- Simple optimization sufficient
- Time pressure (<1 week to decide)
- Incremental improvement acceptable
- Problem is tactical (local, temporary)

---

### 14.3 ARIZ Success Patterns

**High success probability (>80%) when:**
- Contradiction is clearly technical (X improves, Y worsens)
- System is well-defined (clear tool, object, conflict)

- Standard Solutions match problem type
- Psychological inertia is identified and removed

**Lower success probability (<50%) when:**
- Contradiction is vague or philosophical
- System boundaries are unclear
- Problem is administrative (policy, politics)
- Resources are genuinely limited (no VPR to utilize)
