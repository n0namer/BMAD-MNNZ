## STEP GOAL:

Confirm that the create flow finished successfully and provide a clear completion message.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Summarize what was created (plan + project artifacts)
- 💾 Confirm that the workflow is complete

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Confirm Completion

Say:
"✅ **Проект создан и сохранен.**  
Вы можете вернуться к редактированию или обзору в любой момент."

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS
- Completion message delivered
- User understands workflow is complete

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE
- No clear completion confirmation

**Master Rule:** End with a clear completion message.
