# Success Criteria: Что считать успехом

## Quantitative Metrics

### CTR (Click-Through Rate)

**Benchmark:**
- ❌ < 2%: POOR (needs improvement)
- ⚠️  2-3%: FAIR (acceptable)
- ✅ 3-4%: GOOD (above average)
- ⭐ 4-5%: EXCELLENT (top 10%)
- 🚀 > 5%: VIRAL (top 1%)

**Target:** Минимум 3% CTR для нового контента

**How to improve:**
- Hook слабый? → Усилить urgency/curiosity
- Problem не ясная? → Переписать с доказательства
- CTA слабый? → Сделать более явным
- Timing неудачное? → Опубликовать в другое время

### Engagement Rate

**Calculation:** (comments + shares + saves) / views × 100

**Benchmark:**
- ❌ < 1%: POOR
- ⚠️  1-2%: FAIR
- ✅ 2-3%: GOOD
- ⭐ 3-4%: EXCELLENT
- 🚀 > 4%: VIRAL

**Target:** Минимум 2% engagement для целевой аудитории

**How to improve:**
- Эмоциональный триггер слабый? → Усилить emotional resonance
- Нет вопроса для ответа? → Добавить question CTA
- Нет social proof? → Добавить примеры/цифры

### Post Quality Score

**Calculation:** Average of 5 checks (quality/CTR/consistency/copy/engagement)

**Benchmark:**
- ❌ < 70%: NEEDS REWRITE
- ⚠️  70-85%: GOOD ENOUGH (can improve)
- ✅ 85-90%: GOOD (ready to publish)
- ⭐ 90-95%: EXCELLENT (strong post)
- 🚀 > 95%: OUTSTANDING (top performer)

**Target:** Минимум 85% для публикации

**How to achieve:**
- Пост ниже 85%? → Смотри что именно провалилось и доработай
- Несколько элементов слабых? → Используй edit-improvements-checklist.md

## Content Production

### Weekly Output

**Target (per week):**

| Mode | Target | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| CREATE | 3-5 posts | Collaborative creation |
| EDIT | 10-15 posts improved | Batch improvements |
| VALIDATE | 20+ posts checked | Quality assurance |
| YOLO | 10-20 posts | Fast prototyping |
| COMBINED | 30-40 posts/week | Full system |

**Tracking:**
- Используй posts_content_template.csv для отслеживания
- Разбей по неделям и mode
- Смотри metrics для каждого поста

### Variety of Angles

**Target per idea:**
- Минимум: 5 разных углов
- Хорошо: 7-8 углов
- Отлично: 9-10 углов

**Why?** Один угол может не зацепить аудиторию, но другие зацепят

**Tracking:**
- ideas_research_template.csv → sub_angles_count
- angles_library_template.csv → что использовалось
