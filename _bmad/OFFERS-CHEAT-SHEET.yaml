key_success_factors:
  - "Start with Offer 2 + 4 (cash + lead gen)"
  - "Use Offer 2 case studies to launch Offer 1"
  - "Don't launch Offer 3 until you have 2+ validated case studies"

  - "Price Offer 2 high ($15-35K) to fund other offers"
  - "Record Offer 1 videos early (for passive income)"
  - "Use templates to demonstrate expertise (social proof)"

---

  - "Launching Offer 3 (SaaS) before validating market"
  - "Trying to do all 4 offers simultaneously (too chaotic)"
  - "Pricing templates too low (commoditizes)"
  - "Skipping case studies before training bootcamp"
  - "Not using templates as lead gen for services"
  - "Building SaaS without talking to 5+ customers first"
  - "Underestimating sales effort for Offer 2"
